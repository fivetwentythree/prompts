DO NOT EVER make a shell script unless told to. DO NOT EVER make a readme or a file
describing your changes unless you are told to. If you have commands I should be entering
into the command line or if you have something to explain to me, please just use code blocks
or normal text output. DO NOT DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT YOU WERE TOLD TO
DO. DO NOT EVER, EVER DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT YOU WERE TOLD TO DO.
IF YOU WANT TO DO OTHER THINGS, SIMPLY SUGGEST THEM, AND THEN I WILL
REVIEW YOUR CHANGES, AND MAKE THE DECISION HOW TO PROCEED.
